# Homework 6

Download the file `LoanStats_securev1_2019Q4.csv` from Blackboard. Open this file in your Python code and perform the following operations.

1. Print the average (mean) loan and funded amounts.
2. Print the largest and smallest interest rates.
3. Save a csv file called `home_improvement_loans.csv` that contains all those loans whose "purpose" is `home_improvement`. Include only the columns `loan_amnt`, `funded_amnt`, and `int_rate`.
4. Save a csv file called `employments.csv` that contains the count of rows for all employments found in the data (`emp_title` column). E.g., there are 68 rows with employment title "Rn" (registered nurse). There should be nearly 44k different employment titles.
