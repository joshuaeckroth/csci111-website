# Syllabus

CSCI 111Q - 02, Spring 2018 &mdash; Introduction to Computing

An introduction to computing for non-computer science majors or those who have no previous programming experience. Introduction to elementary computer theory, algorithmic thinking, terminology and software applications in either a robotics or multimedia context.

This class satisfies the "Q" Quantitative Reasoning General Learning Outcome: "Students can apply quantitative techniques to solve problems or analyze data, or can apply mathematical or symbolic reasoning to move from a set of assumptions to a conclusion."
  
## About me

- Joshua Eckroth, Assistant Professor of Computer Science, [jeckroth@stetson.edu](mailto:jeckroth@stetson.edu), [homepage](http://www2.stetson.edu/~jeckroth/)

- Eliz Hall 214, 386-740-2519

- Office hours: Mon 11a-12p, 3:30-4:30p; Wed 1:30-2:30p, 3:30-4:30p

## Labs

We'll generally have one lab per week. Each lab assignment is a programming assignment.

Submit your lab by adding your ZIP file to Blackboard. Due dates are listed on the home page of this site.

Late work is penalized 20% for each day that it is late. Submissions more than 3 days late receive no credit. Submit late work to Blackboard, and send me an email telling me you have done so, because I may not see it otherwise. Tests cannot be made up unless a doctor's note is provided.

## Tests

We have two short tests. We have no "final exam," instead we have a final project. The tests are written and submitted on paper.

Test dates:

- Test 1: Wed Feb 14
- Test 2: Wed Apr 4

## Group projects

You will have two group projects. Each group has two members. You
share a grade for the project. Details about project requirements will
be provided later. You will be asked to create a small interactive
game in both cases (the first project will be simpler).

Rather than have a final exam during finals' week, we will have group
presentations for the second, larger project.

## Grading

<table>
<tr><td>Labs</td><td>40%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Test 1</td><td>15%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Test 2</td><td>15%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Group project 1</td><td>10%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Group project 2</td><td>20%</td></tr>
</table>

The grading scale will follow the typical A = 93-100, A- = 90-92, B+ = 87-89, etc.

## Honor code

I want you to utilize the internet, and each other, to learn
Processing but also to learn how to learn. Outside the classroom,
everyone references to the internet, colleagues, and sometimes books,
to learn new technical material.

However, with regards to your lab assignments, you must indicate any
code that you copied, including the source web address of the
code. You are required to contribute most of the code in your lab; do
not turn in a lab mostly written by other people.

I am strongly in agreement with the
[Stetson University Honor Code](http://www.stetson.edu/other/honor-system/). Any
form of cheating is not acceptable, will not be tolerated, and could
lead to dismissal from the University. This includes plagiarism of any
sort on quizzes, exams, or on projects.

## Academic success center

If a student anticipates barriers related to the format or
requirements of a course, she or he should meet with the course
instructor to discuss ways to ensure full participation. If
disability-related accommodations are necessary, please register with
the Academic Success Center (822-7127;
[www.stetson.edu/asc](http://www.stetson.edu/asc)) and notify the
course instructor of your eligibility for reasonable
accommodations. The student, course instructor, and the Academic
Success Center will plan how best to coordinate accommodations. The
Academic Success Center is located at 209 E Bert Fish Drive, and can
be contacted using the email address
[asc@stetson.edu](mailto:asc@stetson.edu).
