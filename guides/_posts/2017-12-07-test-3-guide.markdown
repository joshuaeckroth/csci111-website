# Test 3 Guide

This guide is preparation for Test 3. It is not an assignment. Solutions are [posted](/guides/2017-12-07-test-3-guide-solutions.html). The test will cover loops, arrays, classes, and transformations (scale, rotate, translate). This study guide only includes the new topics: classes and transformations.

## Classs

1\. If you see this code, `Xyz abc;` you can safely assume (in this class) that we are using object-oriented programming. Which of `Xyz` and `abc` is the class? Which is the object? What's a good synonym for "class" (in our usage)? What's a good synonym for "object"?

Here is a class:

{% highlight java %}
class Foo
{
  Foo()
  {
    println("A");
  }
  
  void f1()
  {
    println("B");
  }
  
  void f2()
  {
    println("C");
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

2\. Which message, if any, is printed when we do this: `Foo myfoo;` And what about this: `myfoo = new Foo();` And finally, what about this:`myfoo.f2();`

3\. Which function is the constructor? Which message does the constructor print?

4\. Write the code necessary to declare and initialize an array of 200 `Foo` objects (instances).

5\. Suppose we have this code:

{% highlight java %}
Baz b = new Baz("Claudia");
b.printMany(5); // prints "Claudia" five times, on separate lines
b.printMany(12); // prints "Claudia" twelve times, on separate lines
Baz c = new Baz("James");
c.printMany(3); // prints "James" three times, on separate lines
{% endhighlight %}

Write a class that enables the code above to work as described. You must define this class with exactly seven lines of code, the minimum possible (as far as I know). We count lines of code by ignoring blank lines and lines with only `{` or `}`, and using the normal coding style we have seen in this class.

## Transformations

Consider the following `rect()` command:

{% highlight java %}
rect(0, 0, 20, 100);
{% endhighlight %}

Using scale, rotate, and translate, and using the `rect()` command above **only once**, recreate these images (in separate programs):
