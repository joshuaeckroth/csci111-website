    about Processing.

  - [Hello Processing!](http://hello.processing.org/) --- a series of
    interactive videos (you code along, in the browser), by Daniel
    Shiffman, author of the book *Learning Processing*.

  - [Computer Programming for the Total Beginner](https://vimeo.com/channels/introcompmedia)
    --- a long series of videos that basically replicate much of
    CSCI 111. Also by Daniel Shiffman.

  -
    [The Nature of Code videos](https://vimeo.com/channels/natureofcode)
    --- more videos by Daniel Shiffman. These are much more advanced,
    but the topics are correspondingly much cooler.
    
  - [Fun Programming](http://www.funprogramming.org/) --- a great set of
    videos about Processing, oriented towards people with no
    programming experience
    
## Processing libraries

  - [fisica](http://www.ricardmarxer.com/fisica/) --- a physics toolkit
