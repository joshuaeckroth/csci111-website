# Lab 2

Read about
[animation](/guides/2018-01-22-animation.html) and watch the [video](/videos/2018-01-22-animation.html).

Take your character or image from Lab 1 and animate it in some way. You get to decide how to animate it. You must change the location of one or more shapes, and must change a color.
