# Group project 2

Create a bigger, better game. You may extend your first group project game, but only if it is a substantial extension. You may work by yourself or in a group of 2. You may use Fisica. In fact, I recommend it.

During Dec 14 class, groups may elect to demonstrate their games.

Your code is required to include:

- Images for all visual aspects of your game, or complex Processing shapes.

- Mouse input or keyboard input (or both).

- An opening screen that gives instructions for how to play.

- At least three levels of difficulty. The player(s) may or may not be allowed to choose the difficulty level.

- A way to restart after losing, e.g., by typing the "r" key or clicking a button.

- A score that shows as you play.
  
And make your game look nice!
