# Lab 2

Watch videos about [animation](/videos/2017-08-24-animation.html)
and [conditionals](/videos/2017-08-29-conditionals.html).

Create a program that "rains cats and dogs." In other words, draw some
shapes that look like cats, and some that look like dogs, and animate
them so that they fall down the screen, at a slight angle **to the
right** (there is a slight wind). You must have at least 2 cats and 2
dogs (but they can be the same combinations of shapes, but cats must
look different than dogs), plus appropriate use of color. 
Use random numbers to position each figure in random locations above the top of the screen,
so they smoothly fall into view. Use conditionals
to restart each cat and dog at the top of the screen after each has
completely disappeared off screen at the bottom.

Create an "archive" of your sketch (this creates a ZIP file) and
submit it to Blackboard. You can create an archive by using the Tools
menu in Processing.
