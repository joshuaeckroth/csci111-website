# Lab 4

Read the [notes](/guides/2018-03-12-for-loops.html) about for() loops.

## Gaudy motel carpets

Your task is to use for() loops and shapes and colors to **recreate
one of the following textures**. You must recreate it exactly (within
a few pixels); use the colors specified. You can use a different
window size, if you want, but make it big enough for the texture to
repeat a few times.

### Option 1

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="/images/texture-1.png" />

<p> Colors: #ab6623, #74340e, #e8a204.<br/>This one has the simplest
code, but requires some thinking to get the layering correct. </p>
</div>

### Option 2

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="/images/texture-2.png" />

<p> Colors (in RGB+alpha): red = [203, 0, 0, 128], green =
[86, 102, 35, 220].<br/>The code for this one is simple, conceptually,
but I found it quite difficult to position the lines correctly. And I
have no idea why some green lines appear above, and others below the
red bars. Maybe your solution won't have that problem.</p>
</div>

### Option 3

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="/images/texture-5.png" />

<p>Colors: background = #4e4c4d, gray stroke: #b3b3b3, gray fill:
#666666, yellow: #fbf9c9.<br/> This code is a straight-forward
rows/cols double-for()-loop.  Assuming <code>i</code> is the row and
<code>j</code> is the column, the there is a yellow fill when
<code>(i+2*j) % 4 == 0</code> and a yellow outline when <code>(2*i+j)
% 7 == 1</code>. Be sure to use those rules to exactly recreate this
image.  </p></div>

### Option 4

Recreate this carpet, from *The Shining*:

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="/images/the-shining-carpet-2.jpg" />
</div>

I'll be impressed if you can recreate the more famous carpet.

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="/images/the-shining-carpet.jpg" />
</div>

By famous, I mean, well,

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="/images/shining-carpet-cardigan.jpg" />
</div>
