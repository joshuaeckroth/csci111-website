# Lab 1

Read about the
[coordinate system](/guides/2015-08-21-coordinate-system.html) and
[color](/guides/2015-08-21-color.html).

Your task in this lab is to figure out how to install Processing and
create a "sketch" (their word for a "program") that draws a well-known
cartoon character (a Simpsons character, Disney character,
whatever). The character should be recognizable, but need not be
perfect. You are required to use at least one circle/ellipse, one
rectangle, one triangle, and some lines. You are also required to use
at least three different colors for stroke, fill, and background. The
character must be in the middle of the window.

Create an "archive" of your sketch (this creates a ZIP file) and
submit it to Blackboard. You can create an archive by using the Tools
menu in Processing.
