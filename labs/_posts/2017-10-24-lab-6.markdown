# Lab 6

Read the notes about [for() loops](/guides/2017-09-19-for-loops.html), [arrays](/guides/2017-10-17-arrays.html), and [images](/guides/2017-09-21-images.html), and refer back to the notes about [mouse input](/guides/2017-08-31-mouse-input.html), particularly mouse dragging.

## Puzzle!

Your task is to use for() loops and arrays and images and mouse dragging
to show lots of little pieces of an image (like squares or puzzle shapes),
and allow the user to drag pieces to assemble the puzzle. You do not need
to detect that the puzzle was properly assembled. Just allow the user to
move the pieces around. You must have at least 10 pieces, and you must use
an array to keep track of their locations.

## Starting code

{% highlight java %}
PImage img;
PImage[] pieces = new PImage[16];

void setup()
{
  size(1000, 1000);
  img = loadImage("Jumping-cats22.jpg");
  for(int i = 0; i < 16; i++)
  {
    int w = img.width/4;
    int h = img.height/4;
    int x = i%4 * w;
    int y = i/4 * h;
    pieces[i] = img.get(x, y, w, h);
  }
}

void draw()
{
  //background(0);
  for(int i = 0; i < 16; i++)
  {
    image(pieces[i], random(width), random(height));
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
