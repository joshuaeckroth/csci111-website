# Lab 8

Read the notes about [object-oriented programming](/guides/2017-11-09-object-oriented-programming.html) and watch the corresponding [video](/videos/2017-11-09-oo.html).

Create a bubble-popping game. This game is really simple. Three bubbles appear on the screen (with different colors) and they grow larger and larger. If you click a bubble, it pops (disappears) and starts growing again at some random location. There is no score or time limit, it's just a bubble-popping game.

You must use "object-oriented" design. This means you must create a class (tab), named "Bubble", which defines how a **single** bubble behaves. Then, in your main code (main tab), create **three instances** of this single Bubble class. **Use methods in the class** to control how the bubble draws and grows and pops. You will lose points if your Bubble class draws three bubbles. It should only worry about one bubble, and you should have three instances of the same class. You will also lose points if your main code (main tab) does any extra work that is better handled by the Bubble class.
