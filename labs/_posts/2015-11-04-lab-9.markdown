# Lab 9

Create some "classes" for an object-oriented version of the Pong game.

**Note: we will work on this lab in class. Please come to class so you are not stuck doing this all yourself!**

## Task

- Create a "Ball" class
  - It just bounces around the screen
  - It's just an ellipse (or an image if you're fancy)
  - Create an `update()` function that update's the ball's position, and bounces it off the screen edges
  - Create a `draw()` function that draws the ball
  - Show three on the screen at once (one Ball class, three Ball objects/instances)
- Modify the Ball class
  - Make it bounce off anything that's white, not just the screen edges; use `get(x,y)` to get the pixel color at `x,y`, and check if that pixel color is equal to `color(255)`
  - In the "main" file's `draw()` function, draw some white obstacles (rectangles, triangles, etc.) so you can see the ball bounce off them
  - Make sure you execute the balls' `update()` function *after* the shapes (and paddles, later) have been drawn on the screen, but *before* you execute the balls' `draw()` function
- Create a "Paddle" class
  - It's a rectangle that is on the left or right side of the screen
  - The constructor to the class should have an `int` argument that indicates the `x` position of the paddle
  - Create `moveUp()` and `moveDown()` void functions that move the paddle up and down (but don't let it move off screen)
  - Create two Paddle objects in the "main" file; paddle 1 moves with `UP`/`DOWN` keys, paddle 2 moves with `w`/`s` keys
  - You might want to put the `if(keyCode == UP)` stuff inside `draw()`, inside `if(keyPressed)`; putting it in `draw()`, and checking if the key is pressed 60-times-per-second, will give you smoother movements than if you used the function `void keyPressed()`

Now you should have two paddles that players can move, and three balls that are bouncing off everything that's white.

## Example 1

Just the Ball class.
