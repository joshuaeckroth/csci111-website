# Lab 6

Watch the videos about arrays:
[arrays 1](/videos/2015-09-30-arrays-1.html),
[arrays 2](/videos/2015-09-30-arrays-2.html),
[array utilities](/videos/2015-09-30-array-utilities.html), and
[`for` loops](/videos/2015-09-23-for-loops.html).

Create a program that uses arrays and `for` loops.

You are required to have:

- at least one array
- at least two `for` loops: one in `setup()` and one in `draw()`; you
  can have more, of course
- at least some of the values in the arrays must change over
  time
  
**You must implement one of the following ideas or, if you have your own idea, talk to me so I can "approve" it.**

- show random or cycling text messages (e.g., quotes, an array of type `String`) on the screen in various colors or positions and that get bigger and smaller (e.g., "pop in" and "pop out")

- show "explosions" in which many dots scatter away from the location of a mouse click
  
- many circles at initially-random locations follow the mouse pointer; the circles farther away follow more slowly, but speed up as they get closer
  
- allow the user to drag shapes around the screen, as if assembling a
  jigsaw puzzle
