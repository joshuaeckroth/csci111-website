# Group project 2

Create a bigger, larger game. You may extend your first group project game, but only if it is a substantial extension. **You are not allowed to create Pong.** There are too many Pong solutions online.

Your final game should be the culmination of all that you have learned
in this class. There is one exception: you are not required to use
fisica (physics engine).

Your code is required to include:

- At least two classes in addition to your main file. These classes must have at least 5 functions, combined (not including constructors).

- At least one use each of `pushMatrix()` and `popMatrix()`, and at
  least one use of either (or all of) `scale()`, `rotate()`, and
  `translate()`.
  
- At least one use of `PImage` and `loadImage()`.

- At least one use of an array.

- Mouse input or keyboard input (or both).

Additionally, you are required to have:

- An attractive background image or design.

- An opening screen that gives instructions for how to play.

- At least three levels of difficulty. The player(s) may or may not be
  allowed to choose the difficulty level.

- A way to restart after losing, e.g., by typing the "r" key or clicking a button.

- A list of scores, listed in the order they were obtained (most
  recent first). This is not a "high score" list because it does not
  have player names and all scores are kept (not just the
  highest). For space reasons, display only the most recent 5 or 10
  scores (you choose how many). Show this screen when the player loses
  (or wins). You might find the `expand()` and `shorten()` functions
  from the
  [array utilities](/videos/2014-09-29-array-utilities.html)
  video to be helpful.
