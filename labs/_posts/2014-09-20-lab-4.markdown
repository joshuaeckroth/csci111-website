# Lab 4

Watch the video about [for() loops](/videos/2014-09-20-for-loops.html).

## Gaudy motel carpets and related swank

Your task is to use for() loops and shapes and colors to **recreate
one of the following textures**. You must recreate it exactly (within
a few pixels); use the colors specified. You can use a different
window size, if you want, but make it big enough for the texture to
repeat a few times.

### Option 1

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="/images/texture-1.png" />

<p> Colors: #ab6623, #74340e, #e8a204.<br/>This one has the simplest
code, but requires some thinking to get the layering correct. </p>
</div>

### Option 2

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="/images/texture-2.png" />

<p> Colors (in RGB+alpha): red = [203, 0, 0, 128], green =
[86, 102, 35, 220].<br/>The code for this one is simple, conceptually,
but I found it quite difficult to position the lines correctly. And I
have no idea why some green lines appear above, and others below the
red bars. Maybe your solution won't have that problem.</p>
</div>

### Option 3

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="/images/texture-3.png" />

<p>Colors: green = #0ff3a8, orange = #ffba03, yellow = #fffe03, other
yellow = #ffdf5e, red = #fe3a00, creamy white = #ffffdb.<br/>This
pattern is just rows and columns of two triangles, facing opposite
directions. It is difficult to position the triangles correctly. The
color pattern is also difficult to get right; ask me for advice on
this if you get stuck (note, use modulo %). Your colors need not
exactly match the image, but they should be "scattered" (but not
random).</p> </div>

### Option 4

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="/images/texture-4.png" />

<p>Colors: background = #2b3036, outer stroke = #4a4e57, inner stroke
1 = #6f7390, inner stroke 2 = #948fc7, inner stroke 3 = #b9a5fc.<br/>
This code was very easy, since ellipses are drawn from their
centers. Thus, you do not need much careful pixel positioning. Use a
double-for()-loop (rows & columns). The small circles can be drawn in
the same loop, right after you draw the big circles; just position the
small circles down-and-right from the big circles, for example.  </p>
</div>

### Option 5

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="/images/texture-5.png" />

<p>Colors: background = #4e4c4d, gray stroke: #b3b3b3, gray fill:
#666666, yellow: #fbf9c9.<br/> This code is a straight-forward
rows/cols double-for()-loop.  Assuming <code>i</code> is the row and
<code>j</code> is the column, the there is a yellow fill when
<code>(i+2*j) % 4 == 0</code> and a yellow outline when <code>(2*i+j)
% 7 == 1</code>. Be sure to use those rules to exactly recreate this
image.  </p></div>

### Option 6

Recreate this carpet, from *The Shining*:

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="/images/the-shining-carpet-2.jpg" />
</div>

I'll be impressed if you can recreate the more famous carpet.

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="/images/the-shining-carpet.jpg" />
</div>

By famous, I mean, well,

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="/images/shining-carpet-cardigan.jpg" />
</div>
