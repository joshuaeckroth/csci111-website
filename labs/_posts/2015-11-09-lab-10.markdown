# Lab 10

Using the [fisica library](/guides/2015-11-09-physics.html), create a "platformer" game. A platformer is a game where your character jumps on platforms.

Your game does not need any "win" condition. Just support jumping on platforms and falling off platforms. You may choose to have a ground floor or not.

You must have:

- a character that is controlled by the keyboard, and has an image (need not be animated)
- at least four platforms, each with images (not necessarily different images)
