# Lab 4

This lab is preparation for Test 1. You will take the test on paper. You should expect to see questions like these.

**You may use your computer and the internet during the test (but not communicating with other class members or friends online).**

Write you solutions to these questions in a text file or Word doc or whatever, and submit on Blackboard.

## Color

- what is the command to change to HSB mode?
- what is the code to set the fill/stroke/background color to white or
  black or very-light-gray in RGB mode? in HSB mode?
- what is the code to set the fill/stroke color to 50% transparent
  dark red in RGB mode?
- what is the code to set the background color to bright yellow or
  purple or cyan? (the three simplest combinations of two colors in
  RGB mode)
- what is the command to set a 10 pixel stroke?

Some of these questions have a range of valid answers since, e.g.,
"dark red" is open to some interpretation.

## Coordinate system and shapes

- what is the code to draw a 4x4 square in the middle of a 50x50 window?
- what is the code to draw a 4x4 square in the middle of a window of any size?
- what is the code to draw an ellipse that touches the four edges of a window of any size?
- what is the code to draw a rectangle that covers the entire window
  (and no more)?
- what is the code to draw an arc from 9 o'clock to 12 o'clock?

## Variables and types

- what type should be used to hold the value 55 (not 55.0)?
- what type should be used to hold the value 55.5?
- what type should be used to hold the value "foo bar"
- what type should be used to hold the value of a single symbol that can be typed on the keyboard?
- what type should be used to hold the value true or false?

What is the result of each of the following computations?

{% highlight java %}
57 % 10
57 / 10
2.4 / 2.0
pow(3.0, 2.0)
{% endhighlight %}

If we have `int x = 5`, what is the value of `x` after each of these commands:

{% highlight java %}
x--;
x--;
x *= 2;
x++;
{% endhighlight %}

If we have `boolean q = true`, what is the value of `q` after each of
these commands:

{% highlight java %}
q = false;
q = true || q;
q = !q;
{% endhighlight %}

## Animation

Write the chunk of code (two functions) we will always include when we
start writing a program.

Identify which of the two following chunks of code properly moves a
triangle from the left of the screen to the right.

<table>
<tr>
<td>
{% highlight java %}
int x = 0;
int y = 200;

void setup()
{
    size(400, 400);
}

void draw()
{
    x--;
    background(0);
    triangle(x-50, y+50, x, y, x+50, y+50);
}
{% endhighlight %}
</td>
<td>
{% highlight java %}
int x = 0;
int y = 200;

void setup()
{
    size(400, 400);
}

void draw()
{
    background(0);
    triangle(x-50, y+50, x, y, x+50, y+50);
    x = x + 5;
}
{% endhighlight %}
</td>
</tr>
</table>

Complete this code so that the ellipse starts large but shrinks over
time (its size is allowed to become negative).

{% highlight java %}
int ________________;

void ________________
{
    size(400, 400);
}

void ________________
{
    background(255);
    ellipse(50, 100, ________________);
    
    __________________________;
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Conditionals

- Suppose some shapes are moving according to changing `x` and `y`
  variables. Write some `if` statements that wrap-around `x` and `y`
  on all sides of the window.

- Write some `if/else` statements that do the following: if `x` is
  greater than the middle of the window width, then show text on the
  screen that says `"Too far!"`, otherwise increase the value of `x`.

## Keyboard input

- Write a `void keyPressed()` function that decreases the value of `y`
  if you press the 's' key.

- Write a `void keyPressed()` function that sets `x` (a `float`
  variable) to a random value when the space bar is pressed.

## Mouse input

- Write a complete program that randomly changes the background color
  when the right mouse button is pressed.

- Write a complete program that draws an ellipse wherever the mouse is
  clicked.
