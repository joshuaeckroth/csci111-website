# Lab 11

Using the [fisica library](/guides/2015-11-09-physics.html), create a vehicle with wheels. Support some key presses, including at least LEFT and RIGHT, which make the vehicle move left and right. Create a ground on which to drive; the more interesting the better! (Can you create some jumps or loops?)

- **You must apply a torque on LEFT/RIGHT keypress, not `setPosition` or `setVelocity` or anything like that.** We're simulating a vehicle here!

- **You must also make it look like a car (with images).**

**Extra credit**: create a dancing flower pot or other dancing character. It should gyrate without any interaction (except possibly an initial force).
