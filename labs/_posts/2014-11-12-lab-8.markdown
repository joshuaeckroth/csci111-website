# Lab 8

**(Yes, this lab is due the same day as Lab 7.)**

Write four functions. You are only allowed to use `rect()` once in each function, and it must appear like this:

{% highlight java %}
rect(0, 0, 20, 100);
{% endhighlight %}

Create a window sized 300x300. Use `rectMode(CENTER)` in your `setup()`.

## Function 1

Write a `void` function named `f1`, with no arguments, that draws the following:
