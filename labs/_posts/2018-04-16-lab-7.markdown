# Lab 7

Using the [fisica library](/guides/2018-04-16-physics.html), create a vehicle with wheels. Support some key presses, including at least LEFT and RIGHT, which make the vehicle move left and right. Create a ground on which to drive; the more interesting the better! (Can you create some jumps or loops?)

You must apply a torque on LEFT/RIGHT keypress, not `setPosition` or `setVelocity` or anything like that. We're simulating a vehicle here!
