# Lab 3

Create a program that shows three boxes, and changes the hue of each
box (to a random hue) when the user clicks the box or types the box's
number. Here is an example:

<div style="text-align: center">
<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/104944436" width="500"
height="190" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen
allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

## Hints

Use `colorMode(HSB, 100)` to make it easy to switch hues. Use a `float`
variable for each of the three hues, and set each randomly with
something like `random(0, 100)`.

Display text with the following command: `text("1", 100, 200)`, where
the `"1"` is the text to display, and `100,200` is the x,y
coordinate. Make sure you set the fill to white before writing text
with this command (in HSB mode): `fill(0, 0, 100)` (no color
saturation, maximum brightness). Also, for a larger font size, use
`textSize(32)` in `setup()`.
